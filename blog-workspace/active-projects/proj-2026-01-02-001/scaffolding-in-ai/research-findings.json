    "keyInsights": [
      "Scaffolding (infrastructure) matters more than raw model intelligence - a well-designed system with an average model outperforms a brilliant model in a poorly-designed system",
      "Hooks are event-driven automation that provide automated guardrails, transforming 'dumb' agents into productive builders without making them actually smarter",
      "Planning upfront (even 100k tokens) saves more than endless agentic loops fixing compile issues - scaffolding investment pays dividends",
      "Agents are specialized instances supported by scaffolding, not independent entities - they need context, tools, orchestration, and hooks to be effective",
      "Different hook implementations (Cursor vs Factory Droid) reflect different philosophies: simplicity vs granular control"

  "detailedFindings": {
    "background": "Developers waste significant time manually verifying AI agent outputs - running linters, checking types, fixing compilation errors. This creates the impression that AI agents are 'dumb' when in reality they lack proper infrastructure support. The Model Context Protocol and agentic coding movement have made AI assistants more capable, but without scaffolding, they remain unproductive.",
    "currentState": "Two thought leaders are converging on the same insight from different angles: Daniel Miessler from strategic PAI architecture, Ray Fernando from practical hooks implementation. Both conclude that infrastructure (scaffolding) is the force multiplier that makes agents productive, not waiting for smarter models.",
