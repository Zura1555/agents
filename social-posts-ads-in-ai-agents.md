# Social Media Posts - Ad-Supported AI Agents

## LinkedIn Post

Coding agents like Amp Free and Giga Dev caught my attention first—there's something fascinating about AI that writes code while you grab coffee. Then a few days ago, my newsletter landed with a headline about ChatGPT rolling out ads, and X was buzzing with reports that even paid plans get ads when chatting with ChatGPT.

That's when it clicked: we're witnessing the birth of ad-supported AI.

The landscape is already splitting into three distinct approaches:

**OpenAI's search-integrated ads** leverage 800M weekly users and conversation history for unprecedented targeting. Their financial pressure is real—projected $74B losses by 2028 vs Anthropic's $70B revenue—so advertising isn't just opportunity, it's survival.

**Amp Free** takes a developer-first approach with 13+ partnerships (PlanetScale, Prisma, TailwindCSS). Ads appear unobtrusively in your editor, funding "free mode, built for real work." Smart.

**Giga Dev** went viral with a different model: free Claude Sonnet 4.5 access via social promotion (follow, retweet, verify). 349.4K views on launch. They're charging advertisers per impression instead of users per token.

Which model wins? Hard to say. But the trend is clear: ad-supported AI isn't coming—it's here.

What's your take? Are you comfortable with ads in AI tools if they keep services free?

## X Tweet

First noticed Amp Free and Giga Dev's coding agents. Then my newsletter screamed "ChatGPT Ads!" and X exploded with reports about ads in paid plans too.

Three models emerging:
• OpenAI: search-integrated ads (800M users)
• Amp: dev tool partnerships in editors
• Giga: viral growth via social promotion

The AI monetization shift is happening fast. https://your-site.com/posts/ads-in-ai-agents
